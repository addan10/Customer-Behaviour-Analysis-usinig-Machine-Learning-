In today’s dynamic e-commerce landscape, understanding consumer behavior is key to driving growth. Through comprehensive data analysis, I explored factors influencing consumer behavior, including age, gender, yearly income, sales, website engagement, loyalty programs, and discounts.

Key findings include:
✔ Average yearly income: $84,249.16
✔ Discount utilization: 255.53%
✔ Loyalty program membership: 32.67%
✔ Average website engagement: 30.47 minutes
✔ Average items purchased: 10.42 items

Using a linear regression model, I achieved an R² score of 0.3633, with a mean squared error of 0.156 and a root mean squared error of 0.395—highlighting a strong foundation for predictive accuracy.

These insights empower businesses to enhance consumer engagement and refine their marketing strategies, driving better results in competitive markets. Let’s connect to explore how data-driven decisions can transform your business!
